* Third Review (from Team)
  - [X] Revision from Trello

** [5/8] Overall
  - [ ] index: insert area in km^2
  - [ ] Make hovering more apparent, overall increase contrast of text, icons, etc.
  - [ ] Pop-up error messages to look a little snazzier and re-write the texts in it
  - [X] ==== Diesel price button would be improve to make it clear that we can click on it
  - [X] High diesel price activated by default
  - [X] Separate Scenarios and Underlying Data (maybe color coding?)
  - [X] Rework hierarchy between the summary and detailed data table to make it simpler, more logical and more interactive (ie. Expandable - click for more etc)

** [4/4] State
  - [X] Load randomize results automatically
  - [X] Prioritize graphically population and investments, with having 'areas' and 'capacity' accessible with clicking somewhere
  - [X] Try to improve readability with increasing font and playing with colors in the result table
  - [X] Truncate decimals from investments and capacity
