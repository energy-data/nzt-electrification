* Third Review
** [0/7] Overall
  - [ ] High diesel price activated by default
  - [ ] Diesel price button would be improve to make it clear that we can click on it
  - [ ] Help mode enabled by default
  - [ ] Separate Scenarios and Underlying Data (maybe color coding?)
  - [ ] Make hovering more apparent, overall increase contrast of text, icons, etc.
  - [ ] Pop-up error messages to look a little snazzier and re-write the texts in it
  - [ ] Rework hierarchy between the summary and detailed data table to make it simpler, more logical and more interactive (ie. Expandable -
click for more etc)

** [0/4] State
  - [ ] Look into possibility to reduce number of decimals, especially from investments and capacity
  - [ ] Prioritize graphically population and investments, with having 'areas' and 'capacity' accessible with clicking somewhere
  - [ ] Try to improve readability with increasing font and playing with colors in the result table
  - [ ] Load randomize results automatically


* [0/4] Second Review
  - [ ] missing expenditures and other indicators
