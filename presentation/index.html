            Geospatial analysis is an effective tool supporting the
            planning, implementation and monitoring of basic services
            delivery in developing countries, as reflected by an
            increase in use in a number of geographies and
            sectors. Within the energy sector, the use of GIS data and
            associated analytical tools can be beneficial in conducting
            strategic planning as well as prioritizing and rationalizing
            energy infrastructure related investments.

            have developed National High Resolution Dynamic Least Cost
            Options Plan for Universal Access to Electricity in Nigeria,
            Tanzania and Zambia.  The web-based open source application
            presented here allows the users to select scenarios based on
            electricity consumption targeted (Tiers of access) and
            spatially related fuel costs towards identifying the least
            cost electrification technology for every settlement at a 1

                infrastructure, proximity to road network, night-time
                light, as well as energy resource availability. For each
                location, seven electrification technologies are
                compared and the least cost system is selected depending
                on the tiers of access aimed for. In other words, the
                technology offering the lowest levelized cost of
                electricity generated throughout its lifetime, is
                considered as the best electrification solution. Results

                The quality of the tool's results is directly correlated
                to the quality of data inputs.  It is important to note
                that the tool has been developed using best
                available open data.

                Data gaps and data quality issues, particularly in
                regards to electricity grid location and electricity use
                significantly affect the modelâ€™s outputs. As such, the

              Covering future electricity demand requires investments
              in new generating capacity, with two main options to be
              considered. On the one hand new capacity can be added to
              the national electricity grid which will then electrify
              un-served areas through an extended T&D network spanning
              throughout the country. On the other hand, new off-grid
              capacity can be added, operating either in a form of
              mini-grids or stand-alone systems covering the demand in
              each location based on the locally available energy
              resources.

                <strong>Grid</strong> electricity is generated in a
                centralized manner, usually from large power plants,
                which due to economies of scale are able to offer low
                generating costs.  Electricity then reaches households
                through the Transmission and Distribution network in
                relatively low costs (if the T&D network is well
                developed e.g. developed countries).  However, the
                expansion of the electricity grid infrastructure in a
                country, is a capital intensive and time demanding
                process, which requires long term planning and large
                investments.  A reasonable investment recovery time
                horizon of such investments requires in turn a
                population with high purchasing power and
                sophisticated consumption patterns. It might not be
                economically feasible to extend the central grid if
                the population to be served will only demand, and
                afford, a relatively small quantity of
                electricity. Therefore, grid extension might not be
                the optimal electrification option for low income â€“
                low consumption population in rural areas and
                particularly in remote areas of developing countries.

                  A <strong>mini grid</strong> is an important
                  alternative to grid extension. In this case
                  electricity is generated in a decentralized manner,
                  usually from power plants with generating capacity
                  of few MW. Mini grids are usually deployed based on
                  locally available energy resources such as solar,
                  hydro, wind or can be based on commonly available
                  fuels like diesel. Requiring no transmission and
                  modest distribution costs mini grids can provide
                  affordable electricity to rural, remote and usually
                  densely populated areas with low-medium electricity
                  consumption habits.  Mini grids based on renewable
                  sources have usually high upfront costs but limited
                  operational costs (i.e. fuel).  On the other hand,
                  diesel generators (gensets) are a mature, low cost
                  technology subjected however to operational costs

                The visualization displays buttons to select one of the two diesel prices and one of the electricity consumption levels
                or tiers. It shows a map of the selected country. On the bottom of the page, a summary of the model results is presented.
                This includes - for the selected scenario - the share of each electrification technology for new connections, investment
                needs, area and added capacity.
